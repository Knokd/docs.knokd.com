# Adding followers

A follower is a potential client that is involved with you in a business capacity. They have the ability to create searches and receive notifications on Knokd properties that meet their search criteria.

### Did you know?

<Note>Sharing listing properties with followers is not considered public marketing because they are involved with your brokerage in a business capacity. </Note>

There are three ways to signup a follower.

## Sign-up link

Every agent in Knokd has their own public signup link. To obtain your sign-up link:

1. [Login](https://www.knokd.com/login) to Knokd.
2. Click "Followers" in the left hand navigation.
3. Click "Copy sign up link".
4. Done - Ctrl + P for the link.

When a follower signs up with the link, they will be asked to

* Accept the Terms & Conditions indicating a business relationship with the agent. 
* Setup a search
* Set their notification preferences

## Invite a follower

You can also invite follower via email. To do this:

1. [Login](https://www.knokd.com/login) to Knokd.
2. Click "Followers" in the left hand navigation.
3. Click "Send invite".
4. Enter the email address of the follower you'd like to invite.

The follower will receive an invite via email which will take them to the signup link.

## Add a follower

You can also manually add a follower and setup a search for them.

1. [Login](https://www.knokd.com/login) to Knokd.
2. Click "Followers" in the left hand navigation.
