Hi [first name],

Did you know that up to 1 of 3 properties are shared before they are publicly listed? And many listings never get publicly listed at all? 

I‚Äôve partnered with Knokd to give you access to all Coming Soon, Exclusive and Assignment listings that I come across.

[Insert button to your signup page with text ‚ÄúGet access to off-market listings‚Äù]

All you need to do is set up a search for the home that you are looking for and I will do the rest. If I come across matches for your search, Knokd will help me share them with you as soon as possible.

If you have any questions please let me know,
[Your name here]
