# Buyer and seller flyers

Here are one-pagers for your buyer or seller contacts to help you explain the benefits of the off-market and Knokd. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Recommended use: Print out these flyers and have some available at open houses, or add them to your information booklet in Buyer or Seller presentations. 

Bonus Tip: we have included colour versions, as well as black and white versions. If you do not have colour printing, we recommend using the black and white.
