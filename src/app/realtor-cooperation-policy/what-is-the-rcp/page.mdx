# Realtor Cooperation Policy

Realtor Cooperation Policy (RCP) is a policy implemented by the Canadian Realtor Estate Association (CREA) in Canada. It mandates that all residential listings are placed on a Multiple Listing Service (MLS) after 72 hours of the property being marketed publicly. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Here is the [official policy](https://member.crea.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REALTORR-Cooperation-Policy-March-2023.pdf) provided by CREA and with [updates to the FAQ](https://news2me.crea.ca/new-realtor-cooperation-policy-faqs-available).

## Public Marketing (public-marketing)

The RCP defines public marketing as representation or marketing of a listing to the public or
anyone not directly affiliated with the listing brokerage/office in a business capacity. This includes, but is not limited to:
* flyers
* yard signs
* digital marketing on public facing websites
* brokerage website displays (including IDX and VOW) and onsite brokerage promotion
* digital communications marketing (i.e., email blasts, newsletters, social media posts)
* multi-brokerage listing sharing networks with indiscriminate sharing
* applications available to the general public. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### What isn't Public Marketing?

The following practices are **not** considered public marketing according the RCP:

* Representing or marketing a listing to anyone that is directly affiliated with the listing brokerage / office in a business capacity. Examples of this are brokerage agents, employees, clients and potential clients.
* 1-1 direct communication with a Realtor unaffiliated with the listing brokerage. {{ className: 'lead' }}
