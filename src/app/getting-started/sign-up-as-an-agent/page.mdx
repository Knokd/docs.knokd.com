# Signing up as an Agent

Knokd can be used by teams, brokerages, or individual agents. Get started by signing up as an agent: you will be a part of the same internal network as other agents in your brokerage who are within your [work area](#work-area).

Your [extended network](/getting-started/grow-your-network#your-extended-network) will consist of all agents whose [work area](#work-area) overlaps with yours.

To sign up as an agent:

1. From the <a href="https://www.knokd.ca/" target="_blank">Knokd Home Page</a>, click **Get Started**.
2. Enter your email and complete the sign-up process.

<Note>If you're verified as an agent, you're all done. If not, you need to wait up to 60 minutes for this process to complete. The Knokd team is working hard to speed up this process. </Note>

You can [grow your network](/getting-started/grow-your-network), [add a Contact](/contacts/add-contacts), or [share a listing](/listings/sharing-link). 

## Work area

You can freely set or update your work area in Knokd. Your work area affects:
* What listings are visible to you.
* The size of your [extended network](/getting-started/grow-your-network#your-extended-network) â€“ i.e. agents outside your brokerage with overlapping work areas.

**To set your work area:**

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in</a> to Knokd.
1. Click **Settings**, then click the **Work area** tab.
1. In the embedded map:
    * Use the `+` and `-` buttons to zoom in and out of the region.
    * Click and drag your mouse to pan the viewing area.
1. When full area you like to work in is visible, click **Draw**.
1. Hold your mouse-button down and roughly trace the area you can handle. When finished, release the mouse button.
1. Click **Update**. 

The listings available to you and other agents in your [extended network](/getting-started/grow-your-network#your-extended-network) will all be updated automatically.
