# Signing up as an Agent

Knokd can be used by teams, brokerages, or individual agents. Get started by signing up as an agent: you will be a part of the same internal network as other agents in your brokerage who are within your working area.

Your [extended network](/getting-started/grow-your-network#your-extended-network) will consist of all agents that share a working area with you. 

To sign up as an agent:

1. From the <a href="https://www.knokd.ca/" target="_blank">Knokd Home Page</a>, click **Get Started**.
2. Enter your email and complete the sign-up process.

<Note>If you're verified as an agent, you're all done. If not, you need to wait up to 60 minutes for this process to complete. The Knokd team is working hard to speed up this process. </Note>

You can [grow your network](/getting-started/grow-your-network), [add a Contact](/contacts/add-contacts), or [share a listing](/listings/sharing-link).
