# Signing up as an Agent

Knokd can be use by teams, brokerages or individual agents. When you sign-up as an agent, you will share the same internal network as other agents in your brokerage that share your working area. You external network will consider of all agents that share a working area with you. 

To signup as an agent:

1. Go to the <a href="https://www.knokd.ca/" target="_blank">Knokd Home Page</a>.
2. Click "Get Started".
3. Enter your email and complete the sign-up process.
4. Are you verified as an agent? If yes, you're all set. If no, you need to wait up to 60 minutes for this to happen. We are working to shorten this!
5. All done.

You can grow your network, add a follower, or share a listing.
