# Grow your network

Your network consists of two main groups: [your brokerage](#your-brokerage) and your [extended network](#your-extended-network). 

## Your brokerage

Your brokerage network is made up of all agents in Knokd that are affiliated with the same brokerage as you. There are no RCP restrictions on sharing property listings within your brokerage network.

All listings that you add to Knokd will be shared with members of your brokerage whose working area overlaps with the listing address.

In order to maximise exposure of your listings, invite all local members of your brokerage to your Knokd network.

To invite an agent to view your listing:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in</a> to Knokd.
2. Click **Agents** in the sidebar menu.
3. Click **Invite agent** in the header.
4. Enter the email address of your brokerage memembers.
  <Note>Want to invite many agents at once? Separate their email addresses with commas `,`.</Note>
5. Click **Send**.

They will all receive an invite to join Knokd for free.

## Your extended network

Your extended network is made up of all agents on Knokd that have overlapping work areas with you but are not in your brokerage. [The RCP mandates](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp) that only [1-1 sharing](/listings/1-1-sharing) of residential property listings is permitted with this group if you donâ€™t plan to list your property on MLS.

However, if you do plan to list your property on MLS within 72 hours, you can share your property with your extended network, no restrictions.

If you know any local agents that could benefit from beying on the Knokd network, invite them with the following steps:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in</a> to Knokd.
2. Click **Agents** in the sidebar menu.
3. Click **Invite agent** in the header.
4. Enter the email address of your brokerage memembers.
  <Note>Want to invite many agents at once? Separate their email addresses with commas `,`.</Note>
5. Click **Send**.

You will now be able to 1-1 share [restricted listings](/listings/types-of-listings#restricted-listings) with the invitees. They will also get access to [unrestricted listings](/listings/types-of-listings#unrestricted-listings).
