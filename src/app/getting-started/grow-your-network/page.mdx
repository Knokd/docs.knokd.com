# Grow your network

Your network consists of two main groups: your brokerage and your extended network. 

## Your brokerage

Your brokerage network is made up of all agents in Knokd that are the same brokerage as you. There are no RCP restrictions to sharing property listings with your brokerage group

All listing that you add to Knokd will be shared with members of your brokerage whose working area overlaps with the listing address.

In order to maximise exposure of your listings, invite all local members of your brokerage to your Knokd network.

1. [Login](https://app.knokd.ca/login) to Knokd.
2. Click "Agents" in the left hand navigation.
3. Click “Invite agent” in the top right corner.
4. Enter in the email addresses of your brokerage memembers (pro tip: separate multilpe email addresses with a comma).
5. Press Send.

They will all get an invite to join Knokd for free.

## Your extended network

Your extended network is made up of all agents on Knokd that have overlapping work areas with you and are not in your brokerage. The RCP mandates that only 1-1 sharing of residential property listings is permitted with this group if you don’t plan to list your property on MLS. If you plan to list your property on MLS within 3 days, you can share your property with your extended network without any restrictions.

Know any local agents that could benefit from beying on the Knokd network? Invite them with the following steps:

1. [Login](https://app.knokd.ca/login) to Knokd.
2. Click "Agents" in the left hand navigation.
3. Click “Invite agent” in the top right corner.
4. Enter in the email addresses of your brok (pro tip: separate multilpe email addresses with a comma).
5. Press Send.

You will now be able to 1-1 share [restricted listings](/realtor-cooperation-policy/types-of-listings#restricted-listings) with the invitees. They will also get access to [unrestricted listings](/realtor-cooperation-policy/types-of-listings#unrestricted-listings).
