# Benefits

If you're just getting started with Knokd, here are some examples of what the app can do for you after setup. 

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
<CheckIcon className="mt-12 h-8 w-8 fill-indigo-500/20 stroke-indigo-500 transition-colors group-hover/button:stroke-indigo-400" /> 
## Win more clients
</div>


Clients love to get access to properties that aren’t available to the public. Honestly, who wouldn’t want that? We make it easy for your clients and potential clients to feel like VIPs with access to properties that are not available on the MLS. 

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
<ClipboardIcon className="mt-12 h-8 w-8 fill-indigo-500/20 stroke-indigo-500 transition-colors group-hover/button:stroke-indigo-400" /> 
## Offer unique listing strategies
</div>


In many cases, a potential seller's reluctance or uncertainty about the market or their property may restrict them and their property to being not-for-sale. But what if they could quickly and easily sign with you to get a risk-free look at how their property could sell in the off-market agent network?

Help your clients move from not-for-sale to open-minded with Knokd.

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
<SquaresPlusIcon className="mt-12 h-8 w-8 fill-indigo-500/20 stroke-indigo-500 transition-colors group-hover/button:stroke-indigo-400" /> 
## Increase your listings exposure
</div>

Whether it’s a coming soon or exclusive property, Knokd is built to maximise your listings exposure in your local agent community while remaining RCP compliant.
