# 1-1 Sharing

As per the [Realtor Cooperation Policy (RCP)](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp), directly sharing with agents outside of your brokerage in a 1-1 capacity does not constitute public marketing, and does not trigger the 72-hour public marketing window.

<Note>1-1 sharing is an important strategy to increase the exposure of your [exclusive listings](/listings/types-of-listings#listing-tags). Knokd makes it as easy as possible for you to do that.</Note>

Knokd curates a smart list of all agents whose work areas overlap your listing location. The list is sorted in priority of:

* Contact matches.
* Search matches.
* Size of work area overlap.

When a listing is 1-1 shared with an agent, they:

* Receive an email with the listing details.
* Receive a notification in their dashboard.

We strive to provide simple and effective ways for agents to share non-MLS listings in an RCP compliant manner.
