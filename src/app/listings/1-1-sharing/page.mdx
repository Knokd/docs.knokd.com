# 1-1 Sharing

As per the [Realtor Cooperation Policy (RCP)](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp), directly sharing with agents outside of your brokerage in a 1-1 capacity does not constitute public marketing, and does not trigger the 72 public marketing window.

1-1 sharing is an important strategy for agents to utilise to increase the exposure of their exclusive listings. 

At Knokd, weâ€™ve built a simple way for real estate agents to do just that.

We provide agents with a list of all agents that share their work area with the listing location. The list is sorted in priority of:

* Contact matches
* Search matches
* Size of work area

When a listing is 1-1 shared with an agent, they:

* Receive an email with the listing details
* Receive a notification in their dashboard

We strive to provide simple and effective ways for agents to share non-MLS listings in an RCP compliant manner.
