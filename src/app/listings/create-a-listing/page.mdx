# Create a listing

All Knokd users can add unlimited listings. To add a listing:

1. Click **My listings**.
1. Click **Create listing** in the header.
1. Enter in the details of your listing.

1. If your listing does not include an MLS date then it is considered an [exclusive](/listings/types-of-listings#listing-tags) listing. You will be asked to confirm that you have written permission from you client to abstain from listing on an MLS.
1. If itâ€™s an exclusive listing (no MLS date) then click **Publish**.
