# Create a listing

All Knokd users can add unlimited listings. To add a listing:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.com/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
1. Click **Listings** in the sidebar menu to open a sub-menu.
1. Click **My listings**.
1. Click **Create listing** in the header.
1. Enter in the details of your listing.
1. Click **Save Draft**.
1. If your listing does not include an MLS date then it is considered an [exclusive](/listings/types-of-listings#listing-tags) listing. You will be asked to confirm that you have written permission from you client to abstain from listing on an MLS.
1. If it’s an exclusive listing (no MLS date) then click **Publish**.

See [Knokd listing types](/listings/types-of-listings) to learn more about how listings are shared on Knokd.
