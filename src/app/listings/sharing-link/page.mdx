# Share a listing link

All listings created in Knokd come with a shareable link. This link can be shared 1-to-1 with anyone, but only shared publicly if the listing is within 3 days of MLS or exluded from [RCP](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp) restrictions.

<Note>Shareable links can be shared 1-to-1 with anyone but only can be shared publically (1-to-many) if the listing is [unrestricted](/listings/types-of-listings#unrestricted-listings). </Note>

 To create a listing:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Login</a> to Knokd.
2. Click on Listings on the left navigation
3. Click "Add a listing" in the top right corner.
4. Enter in the details of your listing.
5. Publish as draft
6. If your listing does not include an MLS date then it is considered an exlusive listing. You will be asked to confirm that you have gotten written permission from you client to forgo MLS listing.
6. If itâ€™s an exclusive listing (does not have an MLS date) then 
Publish

See [Knokd listing types](/realtor-cooperation-policy/types-of-listings) to learn more about how listings are shared on Knokd.
