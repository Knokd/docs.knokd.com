# Share a listing link

All listings created in Knokd come with a shareable link.

**CREA Realtors must not share [restricted listings](/listings/types-of-listings#restricted-listings) publicly**.

<Note>Shareable links can be shared [1-to-1 with anyone](/listings/1-1-sharing) even if they are restricted but can only be shared publically (1-to-many) if the listing is [unrestricted](/listings/types-of-listings#unrestricted-listings). </Note>

To copy a listing's shareable link:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
1. Click **Listings** to open a sub-menu.
1. Click **My listings**.
1. Click into the listing you want to share or [add a new one](/listings/create-a-listing).
1. In the **Listing agent** card, click **Copy link to share**.
1. Press `Ctrl + V` to paste the link (`command + V` on a Mac) and share it somewhere of your choosing.

Below is an example of what the shareable link opens up to. All listing links that you get from your account will be **presented by you**, regardless of whether you created the listing or not.
