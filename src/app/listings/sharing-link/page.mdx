# Share a listing link

All listings created in Knokd come with a shareable link. This link can be shared 1-to-1 with anyone, but only shared publicly if the listing is unrestricted.

<Note>Shareable links can be shared 1-to-1 with anyone but only can be shared publically (1-to-many) if the listing is [unrestricted](/listings/types-of-listings#unrestricted-listings). </Note>

Copy your listing link:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in</a> to Knokd.
2. Find the listing you want to share or [add a new one](/listings/create-a-listing).
3. Click "Copy link to share" button on the right hand side.
4. Share your link!

Below is an example of what the shareable link opens up to. All listing links that you get from you account will be **presented by you**, regardless of whether you created the listing or not.
