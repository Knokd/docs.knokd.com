# Listing Types

All listings added to Knokd are either [restricted](#restricted-listings) for sharing, or [unrestricted](#unrestricted-listings).  

## Restricted listings

Restricted listings will not be shared broadly on the Knokd platform due to the [Realtor Cooperation Policy](/welcome-to-knokd/realtor-cooperation-policy). They will only be shared within your brokeage and made available for 1-to-1 sharing with agents outside of your brokerage.

Restricted listings are:
  * Shared only with every member of your brokerage that is on Knokd and in your working area.
  * Shared only with the clients and Contacts (potential clients) of these brokerage agents.
  * Made available for 1-to-1 sharing with agents outside of brokerage.

Examples of restricted listings:
  * Residential listings are **not intended for and MLS**.
  * Residential listings are **more than 72 hours away from being listed on the MLS**.

## Unrestricted listings

Unrestricted listings **will be** shared broadly on the Knokd platform. They will be made available to all agents in your working area.

Unrestricted listings are:
  * Shared with every agent in the Knokd platform in your working area + 50 km.
  * Shared with the clients and Contacts (potential clients) of those agents.

Examples
  * Coming soon listings within 72 hours of MLS listing date.
  * New construction in multi-unit developments (exempt from RCP). 
  * Multi-unit residential with 4 or more units (commercial).

## Listing Tags

In addition to being restricted or unrestricted, listings receive a special tag to help classify them.

One of the following tags will appear on each listing:
* <span><img src="/images/screenshots/listing-tags-exclusive.png" className="listing-tag" alt="Exclusive listing tag" /></span> – The Exclusive listings **is not** scheduled to be posted on the MLS.
* <span><img src="/images/screenshots/listing-tags-coming-soon.png" className="listing-tag" alt="Coming Soon listing tag" /></span> – The Coming Soon listings **do have** an MLS listing date.
* <span><img src="/images/screenshots/listing-tags-assignment.png" className="listing-tag" alt="Assignmentlisting tag" /></span> – All Assignment properties will receive this as the primary tag.

For example:

  alt="A property listing with a tag reading Exclusive"
/>

## Non-CREA agents

By default, Knokd is configured for [CREA REALTORS®](https://www.crea.ca/). If you are a real estate agent who is not a member of CREA, you should update your setting:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
2. Click **Settings** in the sidebar menu.
2. Scroll down to the **Agent information** card.
3. Deselect “I am a member of the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA)”.
4. Click **Update**.

As a non-CREA agent, **all property listings that you add to Knokd will be unrestricted**, and made available to all Knokd users, as well as their clients and [Contacts](/contacts/add-contacts).
