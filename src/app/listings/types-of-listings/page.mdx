# Listing Types

All listings added to Knokd are either [restricted](#restricted-listings) for sharing, or [unrestricted](#unrestricted-listings).  

## Restricted listings

Restricted listings cannot be shared broadly on the Knokd platform due to the [Realtor Cooperation Policy](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp). They can only be shared within your brokeage and 1-to-1 with agents outside of your brokerage.

Still, restricted listings are:
  * Shared with every member of your brokerage that is on Knokd and in your working area.
  * Shared with the clients and Contacts (potential clients) of these brokerage agents.
  * Made available for 1-to-1 sharing with agents outside of brokerage.

Examples of restricted listings:
  * Residential listings are **not intended for and MLS**.
  * Residential listings are **more than 72 hours away from being listed on the MLS**.

## Unrestricted listings

Unrestricted listings **can be** shared broadly on the Knokd platform. They will be made available to all agents in your working area.

Unrestricted listings are:
  * Shared with every agent in the Knokd platform in your working area + 50 km.
  * Shared with the clients and Contacts (potential clients) of those agents.

Examples
  * Coming soon listings within 72 hours of MLS listing date.
  * New construction in multi-unit developments (exempt from RCP). 
  * Multi-unit residential with 4 or more units (commercial).

## Non-CREA agents

By default, Knokd is configured for [CREA REALTORS®](https://www.crea.ca/). If you are a real estate agent that is not a member of CREA, you can go into settings and change the configuration.

1. Login to Knokd.
2. Navigate to "Settings" in the sidebar menu.
2. Scroll down to “Agent information".
3. Unselect “I am a member of the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA)”.

As a non-CREA agent, **all property listings that you add to Knokd will be unrestricted**, and made available to all Knokd users and their clients and followers.
