# Contacts

A contact is a client or potential client that is involved with you in a business capacity. You have exclusivity with your contacts; they can only follow one agent at a time.

<Note>Sharing listings with contacts is **not** classified as [public marketing](/welcome-to-FirstList (formerly Knokd)/realtor-cooperation-policy#public-marketing) according to the RCP.</Note>

Contacts can:
* Log in to FirstList (formerly Knokd) to [create searches](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search#create-a-search).
* Get [searches assigned to them](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search#assign-a-search) by you, the agent.
* Receive notifications about FirstList (formerly Knokd) listings that meet their search criteria.

## Adding contacts

Depending how you want to reach out and invite your contacts, you can:
* Share your [sign-up link](#sign-up-link).
* Send [an email invitation](#send-an-invitation) from within FirstList (formerly Knokd).
* [Add a contact](#add-a-contact) manually.
