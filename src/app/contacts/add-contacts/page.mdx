# Adding contacts

A contact is a client or potential client that is involved with you in a business capacity. You have exclusivity with your contacts; they can only follow one agent at a time.

<Note>Sharing listings with contacts is **not** classified as [public marketing](/realtor-cooperation-policy/what-is-the-rcp#public-marketing) according to the RCP.</Note>

Contacts can:
* Log in to Knokd to [create searches](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search#create-a-search).
* Get [searches assigned to them](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search#assign-a-search) by you, the agent.
* Receive notifications about Knokd listings that meet their search criteria.

Depending how you want to reach out and invite your contacts, you can:
* Give them your [sign-up link](#sign-up-link).
* [Send an email invitation](#invite-a-contact).
* [Add a contact](#add-a-contact) manually.

## Give out your sign-up link

Every agent in Knokd has their own public sign-up link. To obtain your sign-up link:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
2. Click **Contacts** in the left hand navigation.
3. Click **Copy sign up link** in the header (in the `...` menu on mobile).
4. Press `Ctrl + V` to paste the link (`command + V` on a Mac).

When a contact signs up with the link, they will be asked to:

* Accept the Terms & Conditions indicating a business affiliation with the agent. 
* Set up a search.
* Set their notification preferences.

## Invite a contact

You can also invite a contact via email. To do this:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
2. Click **Contacts** in the left sidebar menu.
3. Click **Send invite**.
4. Enter the email address of the contact you'd like to invite.

The contact will receive an invite via email which will take them to the sign-up link.

## Add a contact

You can also manually add a contact and set up a search for them.

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
2. Click **Contacts** in the sidebar menu.
3. Click **Add contact**.
4. Enter their details. 

You can now [create a search](/saved-searches/create-a-search) and [assign them](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search#assign-a-search).
