# Adding contacts

A follower is a potential client that is involved with you in a business capacity. They have the ability to create searches and receive notifications on Knokd properties that meet their search criteria.

### Did you know?

<Note>Sharing listing properties with followers is not considered public marketing because they are affiliated with your brokerage in a business capacity. </Note>

There are three ways to signup a follower.

## Sign-up link

Every agent in Knokd has their own public signup link. To obtain your sign-up link:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Login</a> to Knokd.
2. Select "Contacts" in the left hand navigation.
3. Select "Copy sign up link" in the top right corner (or in the three dots in mobile).
4. Done - Ctrl + P for the link.

When a contact signs up with the link, they will be asked to

* Accept the Terms & Conditions indicating a business affiliation with the agent. 
* Setup a search
* Set their notification preferences

## Invite a contact

You can also invite a contact via email. To do this:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Login</a> to Knokd.
2. Select "Contacts" in the left hand navigation.
3. Select "Send invite".
4. Enter the email address of the contact you'd like to invite.

The contact will receive an invite via email which will take them to the signup link.

## Add a contact

You can also manually add a contact and setup a search for them.

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Login</a> to Knokd.
2. Select "Followers" in the left hand navigation.
3. Select "Add contact".
4. Enter in their details. 

You can now [create a search](/saved-searches/create-a-saved-search) and assign them.
