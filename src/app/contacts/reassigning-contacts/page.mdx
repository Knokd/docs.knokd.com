# Reassigning Contacts

Since [Contacts](/contacts/add-contacts) can only follow one agent at a time, and they have a business relationship with the agent, it's important to ensure that they're connected with the proper agent.

<Note>In order to reassing a contact, you'll need to ensure that [you have team admin priviledges](#becoming-a-team-admin) before you can [reassign a contact](#reassign-a-contact).</Note>

## Become a team admin

Only Team admins are able to re-assign contacts to a new agent. As pre-requisites, you'll need to make sure that:

1. Your account is part of [a team on Knokd](http://localhost:3000/getting-started/sign-up-as-a-team).
2. You are granted admin priviledges within your team.

<Note>If you believe you should be a team admin, please email hello@knokd.com for support.</Note>

## Reassign a contact

If you're a team member with admin priviledges, it's easy to reassign a contact.

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.ca/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
1. Click **Contacts** in the sidebar navigation.
1. Click to select the contact you will reassign.
1. Click **Reassign contact** to open a modal window.
1. Select the contact from the drop-down menu.
1. (optional) **Check** the box to notify the contact, and we'll send them an email update.
1. Click **Reassign**.
