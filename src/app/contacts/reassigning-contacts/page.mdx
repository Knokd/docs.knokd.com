# Reassigning Contacts

<Note>Make sure that [you have team admin priviledges](#become-a-team-admin) in order to [reassign a contact](#reassign-a-contact) to a different team member.</Note>

## Become a team admin

Only Team admins are able to reassign contacts to a new agent. As pre-requisites, you'll need to make sure that:

1. Your account is part of [a team on FirstList](http://localhost:3000/getting-started/sign-up-as-a-team).
2. You are granted admin priviledges within your team.

<Note>If you believe you should be a team admin, please email [support@FirstList.com](mailto:support@FirstList.com) for support.</Note>

## Reassign a contact

If you're a team member with admin priviledges, it's easy to reassign a contact to a new agent.

1. <a href="https://app.firstlist.co/login" target="_blank">Log in to FirstList</a>.
