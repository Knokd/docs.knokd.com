# Agents

A real-estate agent is a dynamic professional who manages client relationships, markets properties, and negotiates deals to close sales efficiently and effectively. Your team/brokerage can have several agents.

<Note>All agent accounts must be verified before accessing FirstList (formerly Knokd).</Note>

## Adding agents

As an admin, you can invite an agent to your team:

1. <a href="https://app.firstlist.co/login" target="_blank">Log in to FirstList (formerly Knokd)</a>.
2. Click **Settings** in the left hand navigation.
3. Click **Manage agents** under **Manage team** section.
4. Click **Add agent to team**, then you can:
  * Search by agent name for registered agents in your brokerage.
  * Enter the agent's email address and send an invite.

You can now [create a listing and assign them](/brokerage-management/admin-create-a-listing) or [remove them from your team](/brokerage-management/removing-an-agent).
