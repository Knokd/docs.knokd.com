# Create a listing - as a Team / Brokerage Admin

All Knokd Admin accounts can add unlimited listings. To add a listing:

1. <a href="https://app.knokd.com/login" target="_blank">Log in to Knokd</a>.
1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar menu to open your agents list.
1. Search for the listing agent and click on their name.
1. Click **Impersonate [Agent Name]** to act as the agent using their account.
1. Click **Listings** in the sidebar menu to open a sub-menu.
1. Click **My listings**.
1. Click **Create listing** in the top right corner.
1. Enter in the details of your listing.
1. Click **Save Draft**.
1. Double check with the right info, then click **Publish**

**Note:** If your listing does not include an MLS date then it is considered an [exclusive](/listings/types-of-listings#listing-tags) listing. You will be asked to confirm that you have written permission from you client to abstain from listing on an MLS. See [Knokd listing types](/listings/types-of-listings) to learn more about how listings are shared on Knokd.
